        <h1>Overview of Project</h1>
        <p>
            This project aims to develop a new website for Cratis, a company specializing in remote meat thermometers.
            The website will serve as an online platform for showcasing and selling the thermometer, providing a 
            seamless e-commerce experience for customers. The current website is outdated and lacks user-friendly 
            features, resulting in subpar user experience and limited online visibility for the product. 
            The proposed website will address these challenges by implementing a user-centric design, 
            e-commerce functionality, mobile responsiveness, search engine optimization, and social media 
            integration.
